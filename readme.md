## Research Questions for LLM Evaluation

### Easy Questions (Direct Data Retrieval)
1. Which team has the highest **win_pctg**?
2. Which team leads in **shot_pctg**?
3. Which teams are above the league-average **draw_pctg**?
4. What is the **median goals_per_game** across teams?

### Medium Questions (Data Analysis & Comparison)
5. Among teams with above-average **draw_pctg**, which allowed the fewest **goals_allowed_per_game**?
6. Is **win_pctg** more correlated with **draw_pctg** or **shot_pctg**?
7. Which teams have positive **(goals_per_game − goals_allowed_per_game)** but below-average **shot_pctg**?

### Hard Questions (Statistical Modeling & Strategic Analysis)
8. Fit a simple linear model: **win_pctg ~ draw_pctg + shot_pctg + turnovers_per_game**. Which feature has the largest standardized effect?
9. If a team raises **draw_pctg** by 5 points, how much does the model predict **win_pctg** changes (holding others constant)?
10. Recommend one metric to improve for a "two-more-wins" goal next season; justify with the model and team's current stats.

### Additional Complex Questions (Strategic & Contextual Analysis)
11. **Identify the most "unlucky" team:** Which team has significantly better offensive and defensive statistics than their win percentage would suggest?
12. **Player development priority:** For a team currently at 0.400 win percentage, should they prioritize improving their worst-performing metric or enhancing their best-performing metric? Provide data-driven reasoning.
13. **Conference strength analysis:** Using team performance metrics, rank the conferences by competitive strength and identify which conference shows the most parity.
14. **Resource allocation question:** A coach has limited practice time - should they spend 70% on offense, 70% on defense, or 50/50 split? Use correlation analysis and diminishing returns theory.
15. **Playoff prediction:** Based on the statistical patterns, what minimum thresholds in 3 key metrics would a team need to achieve to have an 80% probability of making playoffs?

## Expected LLM Challenges and Validation Strategy

### Anticipated Difficulties
- **Easy Questions:** Should be answered correctly with minimal prompting
- **Medium Questions:** May require clarification of "above-average" definitions

### Key Findings and Insights

**Unexpected Results:**
1. **Complex Questions Outperformed Simpler Ones:** GPT-4 Turbo scored 68% on complex strategic questions vs 50.8% on basic data retrieval
2. **Data Access Critical:** Many failures were due to incomplete data subsets rather than reasoning limitations
3. **Strong Methodology Understanding:** Even failed questions showed solid statistical methodology

**LLM Strengths Observed:**
